    <h1>Tags</h1>
<u>Tags</u> are major part of HTML. A tag directs the browser on how it should show the different content of a website.<br>
Like Text formatting or showing images.

<p>Tags have the general format of</p>

<code>&lt</code><em>TagLettersOrComand</em><code>&gt</code>Content/Text<code>&lt</code>
<em><strong>/</strong>TagLettersOrComand</em><code>&gt</code>
<br><br><br>

There are two different syntax from the standard tags; 
<ul>
  <li><b><em>Void</em></b></li>
  <u>Void</u> tags don't require a closing, example the break line tag 
<code>&ltbr&gt</code> doesn't require: <pre>&lt<s>/br</s>&gt</pre>
  
  <li><b><em>Attributes</em></b></li>
<u>Attribute</u> defines extra options for the tag or provide needed information. 
Some attributes are Mandatory (required) & some are Optional.<br>
  
  <code>&lt</code><em>Tag attribute="value"</em><code>&gt</code> Content
  <code>&lt</code><em><strong>/</strong>Tag</em><code>&gt</code>
</ul>



There are two types of tags
<ol>
  <li>Inline</li>
  <li>Block</li>
</ol>

<p><u>Inline Tag</u> Keeps the text on same line. It doesn't add extra white spaces.
It's best understood when compared with the Block type.</p>
<p><u>Block Tag</u> It has the effect of surrounding the tagged text with invisible box
  that has width and height. It separate the text from surrounding text by providing white space
  through the borders of the invisible box.

<br>
Two famous tags, DIV and SPAN, are used as containers for other HTML elements.
They are used mostly with <em>CSS</em>.<br>
DIV is a Block tag.
SPAN is an inline tag.
<br>
<br>

<p><em><b>Trivia:</b></em></p>
These are from personal experience and might be wrong.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Many Inline Tags have corresponding Block Tags. Examples:<br>
  Span, Div<br>
  br, p <br>
  code, pre
  </li>
  <li>
    If you forgot to close a formatting tag like <b>b</b> or <em>em</em> all the text after the starting tag will be formatted!
    
  </li>
  <li>
    Inline! Block! Why we shall know the diffence between them .. as per my research they are very useful in styling with CSS
  </li>
  <li>
    There is third secret type of tags that is usually sorted as inline (but not exactly inline); it is called <b>Replaced Elements</b>: <em>img</em> is one of them!
  </li>
</ul>

<h1>World Wide Web</h1>
<p>The world Wide Web (www) is a collection of HyperText Markup Language pages (HTML) on millions of computers.</p>
<p>To connect to the net you need a browser (like Chrome or Firefox) which interpret  and show HTML pages properly and formatted. The browser communicate with servers through out the world through Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP); which is a simple protocol for HTML transfer. The servers deliver back to your browser the requested page and information.</p>

<h1>Programmers 5 ways of thinking:</h1>

<h2>Procedural Thinking:</h2>
What are the procedures that need to be followed to achieve a certain task.
Like for hand to pick up a pencil and write with it, though it looks simple
it requires a lot of procedures: finding the pencil, coordinate the eye with
hands to get the pencil, holding the pencil with proper force, identifying
its shape (tip, end, length), rotating the pencil in a certain way, finding
papers, finding starting point of writing, applying proper pressure on 
thetip … etc

<h2>Abstract Thinking:</h2>
To see similarities in things allowing some tools to be reused rather than 
re-inventing the wheel. Abstract thinking is clear in websites designs 
through CSS.

<h2>System thinking:</h2>
Is linking the ideas (like the procedures) in an organised way to know how
to go about it, where to start and what to do next… I feel it is like a project plan.


<h2>Machine Empathy:</h2>
To understand how the computer work. How the computer interpret the commands.
What is its capabilities language wise.

<h2>Debugging:</h2>
To have a systematic way to find mistakes and toggle bugs.
Usually it contains these steps:
<ul>
  <li>What is the symptoms of the mistake; the actions, messages, behavior it is creating.</li>
  <li>In what stage it happen (approximate location if possible).</li>
	<li>Putting theories about how this happen.</li>
	<li>Testing the theories.</li>
	<li>Fixing the mistake</li>
</ul>
